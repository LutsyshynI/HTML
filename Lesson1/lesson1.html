        His favorite color is blue and he enjoys dancing, eating donuts, drinking, hugging, driving a sit-down arcade

        Bartholomew "Bart" Jojo Simpson (born April 1 or February 23) is the mischievous, rebellious,
        misunderstood, disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He is
        the only son of Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed
        "Cosmo", after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such
        as "Critical Hit", "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series
        entitled the Simpson Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother,
        Mark Groening.

        Even at a young age, Bart has accomplished many feats. He has won an award for his Angry Dad web series, he
        has discovered a new comet which was named after him, and he also has performed in a successful band with
        Milhouse Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum.

    <p>
        Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9) is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one of the
        two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.

        In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train called
        Lil' Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard
        achievement of the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral
        center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to
        hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In
        school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only
        a few friends. She focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is
        already a member of Mensa with an IQ of 159. Her lack of parental involvement also leads to her lashing out to
        those who she deems lower than her or even above her. She has extreme jealously from time to time and will do
        whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the smartest; but only if she deems it necessary. Otherwise, she's the
        intelligent one who usually thinks things through.
